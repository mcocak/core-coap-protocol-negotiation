 <abstract>    
  <t>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol.
  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource
  representations, this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as
  well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate transport and protocol
  configurations as well as URIs for CoAP messaging. Several mechanisms are
  proposed: Extending the CoRE Resource Directory with new parameter types,
  introducing a new CoAP Option with which clients can interact directly with
  servers without needing the Resource Directory, and finally a new CoRE Link
  Attribute allowing exposing alternate locations on a per-resource basis.

 <section title="Introduction">

   <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/>
   allows clients, origin servers and proxies, to exchange and manipulate
   resource representations using REST-based methods over UDP or DTLS. CoAP
   messaging however can use other alternative underlying
   transports <xref
   target="I-D.silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports"/>.</t>
   
   <t>When CoAP-based endpoints and proxies possess the ability to perform CoAP
   messaging over multiple transports, significant benefits can be obtained if
   communicating client endpoints can discover that multiple transport bindings
   may exist on an origin server over which CoAP resources can be retrieved.
   This allows a client to understand and possibly substitute a different
   transport protocol configuration for the same CoAP resources on the origin
   server, based on the preferences of the communicating peers. Inevitably, if
   two CoAP endpoints reside in distinctly separate networks with orthogonal
   transports, a CoAP proxy node is needed between the two networks so that CoAP
   Requests and Responses can be exchanged properly.</t>
   
   <t>A URI in CoAP, however, serves two purposes simultaneously. It firstly
   functions as a locator, by specifying the network location of the endpoint
   hosting the resource, and the underlying transport used by CoAP for accessing
   the resource representation. It secondly identifies the name of the specific
   resource found at that endpoint together with its namespace, or resource
   path. A single CoAP URI cannot be used to express the identity of the
   resource independently of alternate underlying transports or protocol
   configuration. Multiple URIs can result for a single CoAP resource
   representations if:</t>
   
   <t><list style="symbols">

    <t>the authority components of the URI differ, owing to the same physical
    host exposing several network endpoints. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap://example.net/sensors/temperature"</t>

    <t>the scheme components of the URI differ, owing to the origin server
    exposing several underlying transport alternatives. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap+tcp://example.org/sensors/temperature"</t>
    
    <t>the path components of the URI differ, should an origin server also allow
    alternative transport endpoint such as the WebSocket protocol, to be
    expressed using the path. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap+ws://example.org/ws-endpoint/sensors/temperature"</t>

   </list></t>
   
   <t>Without a priori knowledge, clients would be unable to ascertain if two or
   more URIs provided by an origin server are associated to the same
   representation or not. Consequently, a communication mechanism needs to be
   conceived to allow an origin server to properly capture the relationship
   between these alternate representations or locations and then subsequently
   supply this information to clients. This also goes some way in limiting URI
   aliasing [WWWArchv1].</t>

   <t> In order to support CoAP clients, proxies and servers wishing to use CoAP
   over multiple transports, this draft proposes the following:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols">
    <t>An ability for servers to register supported CoAP transports to a CoRE
    Resource Directory <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/> with optional registration lifetime values</t>

    <t>A means for CoAP clients to interact with a CoRE resource directory
    interface for requesting and discovering alternative transports and
    locations of CoAP resources</t>
    
    <t>New Resource Directory parameter types enabling the above-mentioned features.</t>
    
    <t>A new CoAP Option called Alternative-Transport that can be used by CoAP clients to discover and retrieve the types of alternative transports available at the origin server, as well as the links describing the transport-specific endpoint address at which CoAP resources are exposed from.
</t>
    <t>A new CoRE Link attribute for exposing transports and endpoint locations on an origin server on a per-resource basis.</t>

   </list></t>

 </section>

 <section title="Aim">
   <t>The following simple scenarios aim to better portray how CoAP protocol
   negotiation benefits communicating nodes</t>
   
   <section title="Overcoming Middlebox Issues">
    <t>Discovering which transports are available is important for a client to
    determine the optimal alternative to perform CoAP messaging according to its
    needs, particularly when separated from a CoAP server via a NAT. It is
    well-known that some firewalls as well as many NATs, particularly home
    gateways, hinder the proper operation of UDP traffic. NAT bindings for
    UDP-based traffic do not have as long timeouts as TCP-based traffic.</t>

    <t><xref target="NAT-TCP"/> depicts such a scenario, where a CoAP client
    residing behind a NAT uses UDP initially for accessing a CoAP Server, and
    engages in discovering alternative transports offered by the server. The
    client subsequently decides to use TCP for CoAP messaging instead of UDP to
    set up an Observe relationship for a resource at the CoAP Server, in order
    to avoid incoming packets containing resource updates being discarded by the
    NAT.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Better resource caching and serving in proxies">
    <t><xref target="proxy-caching"/> outlines a more complex example of
    intermediate nodes such as CoAP-based proxies to intelligently cache and
    respond to CoAP or HTTP clients with the same resource representation
    requested over alternative transports or server endpoints. As with the
    earlier example, the CoAP Server registers its transports to a Resource
    Directory (This is assumed to be performed beforehand and not depicted in
    the figure, for brevity)</t>

    <t>In this example, a CoAP over WebSockets client successfully obtains a
    response from a CoAP forward proxy to retrieve a resource representation
    from an origin server using UDP, by supplying the CoAP server's endpoint
    address and resource in a Proxy-URI option. Arrow 1 represents a GET request
    to "coap+ws://proxy.example.com" which subsequently retrieves the resource
    from the CoAP server using the URI "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature",
    shown as arrow 2.</t>

    <t>Subsequently, assume an HTTP client requests the same resource, but
    instead specifies a CoAP over TCP alternative URI instead. Arrow 3
    represents this event, where the HTTP client performs a GET request to
    "http://proxy.example.com/coap+tcp://example.org/sensors/temperature". When
    the proxy receives the request, instead of immediately retrieving the
    temperature resource again over TCP, it first verifies either from the Resource Directory or directly from the server,
    whether the cached resource retrieved over UDP is a valid equivalent
    representation of the resource requested by the HTTP client over TCP. Upon confirmation, the proxy is able to supply the same cached
    representation to the HTTP client as well (arrow 4).</t>

   <section title="Interaction with Energy-constrained Servers">

    <t><xref target="using-sms"/> illustrates discovery and communication
    between a CoAP client and an energy-constrained CoAP Server. Such a server
    aims at conserving its energy unless a need arises otherwise. The figure
    first depicts the server registering itself to a Resource Directory over IP,
    and also supplies its alternative CoAP transport endpoints (in this case,
    SMS), in steps 1 and 2. The server can subsequently disable communication
    radio interfaces requiring greater energy (such as for IP-based
    comunication), powering it up sporadically for maintenance activities like
    registration renewals. At other times, it maintains communication in
    a low-power state by listening only for incoming SMS messages.</t>

    <t>A CoAP client wishing to perform CoAP operations with an
    energy-constrained CoAP server may query a resource directory for the
    SMS-based endpoint of the server (steps 3 and 4). Subsequently, SMS-based
    CoAP communication can occur between the endpoints as shown by arrows 5 and
    6. Alternatively, the incoming SMS can be also used by the server as a
    triggering event to temporarily power up its radio interface so that UDP or
    other transport-based CoAP communication can instead be
    employed for low latency communication with the client.</t>

 <section title="Node Types based on Transport Availability">
        
   <t>In <xref target="RFC7228"/>, Tables 1, 3 and 4 introduced classification
   schemes for devices, in terms of their resource constraints, energy
   limitations and communication power. For this document, in addition to these
   capabilities, it seems useful to also identify devices based on their
   transport capabilities.</t>

   <t>Type T0 nodes possess the capability of exactly 1 type of transport
   channel for CoAP, at all times. These include both active and sleepy nodes,
   which may choose to perform duty cycling for power saving.</t>

   <t>Type T1 nodes possess multiple different transports, and can retrieve or
   expose CoAP resources over any or all of these transports. However, not all
   transports are constantly active and certain transport channels and
   interfaces could be kept in a mostly-off state for energy-efficiency, such as
   when using CoAP over SMS.</t>
     
   <t>Type T2 nodes possess more than 1 transport, and multiple transports are
   simultaneously active at all times in a persistent manner. CoAP proxy nodes
   which allow CoAP endpoints from disparate transports to communicate with each
   other, are a good example of this.</t>

<section title="New Resource Directory Parameters">
  <t>In order to allow resource interactions between clients and servers with multiple
    locations or transports, the registration, update and lookup interfaces of
    the CoRE Resource Directory need to be extended. In this section two new RD
    parameters, "at" and "tt" are introduced. Both are optional CoAP features.
    If supported, they occur at the granularity level of an origin server, ie.
    they cannot be applied selectively on some resources only. When absent, it
    is assumed that the server does not support multiple transports or
    locations.</t>
 
 <section title="The 'at' RD parameter">
  <t>A CoAP server wishing to advertise its resources over multiple transports
  does so by using one or more "at" parameters to register CoAP alternative
  transport URIs with a Resource Directory. Such a URI would
  contain the scheme, address as well as any port or paths at which the server is available.</t>

<t>When included in a Request message, this option is used by the client in 2 possible ways. In the first case, a CoAP client can include the Option with Length 0 to retrieve all alternative transports from a CoAP server. In response to the client, the server includes base URI for each transport in its own Option. In the second case, a CoAP client can include the Option with a specific value in a CoAP Request, and the CoAP server returns the base URI(s) for the specified transport. If the specified transport by a CoAP client returns multiple results on a CoAP server, the server returns all base URIs of the transport in the response, each base URI in its own Option.</t>

<t>A CoAP client can also use this Option to retrieve several transports at once by including multiple Options in the request to a CoAP server. If any of the specified transports is supported by the server, the server returns all base URIs in its own option. There can be more than 1 result for any of the transports so that each transport base URI is still included in the response in its own option.</t>

<t><xref target="Option-null"/> describes a simple interaction between a client and a server, in which the client uses an Alternative-Transports Option with a null value to discover and retrieve all the available transports from the server, as part of a GET operation to retrieve a resource representation. The server responds with a CoAP Response message which contains the resource representation as a payload. In addition, the server also supplies multiple Alternative-Transport Options in the message, with each Option containing the base URI for an available transport. In this case the base URIs returned for TCP-based and WebSocket transports indicate their availability over a non-standard port.</t>

<section title="The 'ol' CoRE Link Attribute">

   <t>In the majority of cases, it is expected that an origin server would expose all its resources uniformly on its available transports or endpoint addresses. Exceptions can exist however, where alternate locations are made available on a per-resource basis. For such cases, a new 'ol' ("other locations") attribute is provided. One or more 'ol' attributes are used to provide base URIs from which a specific resource can be reached. Allowing per-resource endpoint or transport availability enables specific functions such as firmware updates or hardware-specific operations. It also facilities mapping to and from OCF-based resource-specific endpoint descriptions.</t>

 <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

   <t>When multiple transports, locations and representations are used, some
   obvious risks are present both at the origin server as well as by requesting
   clients.</t>
     
<!-- To be uncommented once an on-demand mechanism is discovered.

   <t>An energy-constrained node exposing its resource representations using
   CoAP over SMS, but subsequently enabling its IP interface on-demand, can be
   subjected to denial-of-sleep as well as battery draining attacks by
   attackers. The risk can be somewhat mitigated at the server by strict
   requirements on the active lifetime of IP-based communication as well as
   restricting which clients are allowed to request for IP-based communication
   and referring other incoming requests to a caching proxy instead.</t>
-->
   <t>When a client is presented with alternate URIs for retrieving resources,
   it presents an opportunity for attackers to mount a series of attacks, either
   by hijacking communication and masquerading as an alternate location or by
   using a man-in-the-middle attack on TLS-based communication to a server and
   redirecting traffic to an alternate location. A malicious or compromised
   server could also be used for reflective denial-of-service attacks on
   innocent third parties. Moreover, clients may obtain web links to alternate
   URIs containing weaker security properties than the existing session.</t>
