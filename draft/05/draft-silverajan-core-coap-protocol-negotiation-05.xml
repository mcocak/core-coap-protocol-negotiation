 <abstract>    
  <t>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol.
  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource
  representations, this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as
  well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate transport and protocol
  configurations as well as URIs for CoAP messaging, using the CoRE Resource Directory.
  </t>

 <section title="Introduction">

   <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/>
   allows clients, origin servers and proxies, to exchange and manipulate
   resource representations using REST-based methods over UDP or DTLS. CoAP
   messaging is however being extended to use other alternative underlying
   transports. These include reliable transports such as TCP, WebSockets and
   TLS. In addition, the use of SMS as a CoAP transport remains a
   possibility for simple communication in cellular networks.</t>
   
   <t>When CoAP-based endpoints and proxies possess the ability to perform CoAP
   messaging over multiple transports, significant benefits can be obtained if
   communicating client endpoints can discover that multiple transport bindings
   may exist on an origin server over which CoAP resources can be retrieved.
   This allows a client to understand and possibly subsitute a different
   transport protocol configuration for the same CoAP resources on the origin
   server, based on the preferences of the communicating peers. Inevitably, if
   two CoAP endpoints reside in distinctly separate networks with orthogonal
   transports, a CoAP proxy node is needed between the two networks so that CoAP
   Requests and Responses can be exchanged properly.</t>
   
   <t>A URI in CoAP, however, serves two purposes simultaneously. It firstly
   functions as a locator, by specifying the network location of the endpoint
   hosting the resource, and the underlying transport used by CoAP for accessing
   the resource representation. It secondly identifies the name of the specific
   resource found at that endpoint together with its namespace, or resource
   path. A single CoAP URI cannot be used to express the identity of the
   resource independently of alternate underlying transports or protocol
   configuration. Multiple URIs can result for a single CoAP resource
   representations if:</t>
   
   <t><list style="symbols">

    <t>the authority components of the URI differ, owing to the same physical
    host exposing several network endpoints. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap://example.net/sensors/temperature"</t>

    <t>the scheme components of the URI differ, owing to the origin server
    exposing several underlying transport alternatives. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap+tcp://example.org/sensors/temperature"</t>
    
    <t>the path components of the URI differ, should an origin server also allow
    alternative transport endpoint such as the WebSocket protocol, to be
    expressed using the path. For example,
    "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature" and
    "coap+ws://example.org/ws-endpoint/sensors/temperature"</t>

   </list></t>
   
   <t>Without a priori knowledge, clients would be unable to ascertain if two or
   more URIs provided by an origin server are associated to the same
   representation or not. Consequently, a communication mechanism needs to be
   conceived to allow an origin server to properly capture the relationship
   between these alternate representations or locations and then subsequently
   supply this information to clients. This also goes some way in limiting URI
   aliasing [WWWArchv1].</t>

   <t> In order to support CoAP clients, proxies and servers wishing to use CoAP
   over multiple transports, this draft proposes the following:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols">
    <t>An ability for servers to register supported CoAP transports to a CoRE
    Resource Directory <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory"/> with optional registration lifetime values</t>

    <t>A means for CoAP clients to interact with a CoRE resource directory
    interface for requesting and discovering alternative transports and
    locations of CoAP resources</t>
    
    <t>New Resource Directory parameter types enabling the above-mentioned features.</t>

   </list></t>

<t>(Note: Although previous versions of this draft provided a mechanism for CoAP clients to directly interact with, discover, use and possibly even negotiate an alternative transport for CoAP-based communication directly with an origin server, discussions at the CoRE Working Group yielded new insights about problems with the proposed approach [CoREWG96]. The current version consequently adopts the usage of the CoRE Resource Directory. Future work is planned on performing discovery and negotiation without the RD as well.)</t>
 </section>

 <section title="Aim">
   <t>The following simple scenarios aim to better portray how CoAP protocol
   negotiation benefits communicating nodes</t>
   
   <section title="Overcoming Middlebox Issues">
    <t>Discovering which transports are available is important for a client to
    determine the optimal alternative to perform CoAP messaging according to its
    needs, particularly when separated from a CoAP server via a NAT. It is
    well-known that some firewalls as well as many NATs, particularly home
    gateways, hinder the proper operation of UDP traffic. NAT bindings for
    UDP-based traffic do not have as long timeouts as TCP-based traffic.</t>

    <t><xref target="NAT-TCP"/> depicts such a scenario. Step 1 depicts the CoAP
    Server registering its transports to a Resource Directory. A CoAP client
    uses UDP initially for accessing a CoAP Server in Step 2 and receives a
    response in Step 3. Subsequently a CoAP client, residing behind a NAT,
    performs a lookup on the Resource Directory in Step 4 to discover
    alternative transports offered by the server. Steps 5 and 6 illustrate the
    client then deciding to use TCP for CoAP messaging instead of UDP to set up
    an Observe relationship for a resource at the CoAP Server, in order to avoid
    incoming packets containing resource updates being discarded by the NAT.</t>

   <section title="Better resource caching and serving in proxies">
    <t><xref target="proxy-caching"/> outlines a more complex example of
    intermediate nodes such as CoAP-based proxies to intelligently cache and
    respond to CoAP or HTTP clients with the same resource representation
    requested over alternative transports or server endpoints. As with the
    earlier example, the CoAP Server registers its transports to a Resource
    Directory (This is assumed to be performed beforehand and not depicted in
    the figure, for brevity)</t>

    <t>In this example, a CoAP over WebSockets client successfully obtains a
    response from a CoAP forward proxy to retrieve a resource representation
    from an origin server using UDP, by supplying the CoAP server's endpoint
    address and resource in a Proxy-URI option. Arrow 1 represents a GET request
    to "coap+ws://proxy.example.com" which subsequently retrieves the resource
    from the CoAP server using the URI "coap://example.org/sensors/temperature",
    shown as arrow 2.</t>

    <t>Subsequently, assume an HTTP client requests the same resource, but
    instead specifies a CoAP over TCP alternative URI instead. Arrow 3
    represents this event, where the HTTP client performs a GET request to
    "http://proxy.example.com/coap+tcp://example.org/sensors/temperature". When
    the proxy receives the request, instead of immediately retrieving the
    temperature resource again over TCP, it first verifies from the Resource Directory
    whether the cached resource retrieved over UDP is a valid equivalent
    representation of the resource requested by the HTTP client over TCP. Upon confirmation, the proxy is able to supply the same cached
    representation to the HTTP client as well (arrow 4).</t>

   <section title="Interaction with Energy-constrained Servers">

    <t><xref target="using-sms"/> illustrates discovery and communication
    between a CoAP client and an energy-constrained CoAP Server. Such a server
    aims at conserving its energy unless a need arises otherwise. The figure
    depicts the server maintaining its communication in a low-power state by
    listening only for incoming SMS messages while disabling communication on
    radio interfaces requiring greater energy. This is depicted as the server's
    initial state in the figure, showing an active SMS endpoint and a disabled
    or dormant UDP interface.</t>

    <t>A CoAP client wishing to perform CoAP operations can query a CoAP server
    for available transports via SMS, as shown in arrow 1. Upon reception of the
    message, should the server have its radio and IP interface up, it can send
    an SMS response containing the location of the CoAP IP endpoint and
    supported transports. Alternatively, the incoming SMS can be also used by
    the server as a triggering event to temporarily power up its radio interface
    so that UDP or other transport-based CoAP communication can instead be
    employed, and likewise provide this information in its response. This is
    depicted as arrow 2. Subsequently, low latency IP-based CoAP communication
    can occur between the endpoints as shown by arrows 3 and 4.</t>

 <section title="Node Types based on Transport Availability">
        
   <t>In <xref target="RFC7228"/>, Tables 1, 3 and 4 introduced classification
   schemes for devices, in terms of their resource constraints, energy
   limitations and communication power. For this document, in addition to these
   capabilities, it seems useful to also identify devices based on their
   transport capabilities.</t>

   <t>Type T0 nodes possess the capability of exactly 1 type of transport
   channel for CoAP, at all times. These include both active and sleepy nodes,
   which may choose to perform duty cycling for power saving.</t>

   <t>Type T1 nodes possess multiple different transports, and can retrieve or
   expose CoAP resources over any or all of these transports. However, not all
   transports are constantly active and certain transport channels and
   interfaces could be kept in a mostly-off state for energy-efficiency, such as
   when using CoAP over SMS.</t>
     
   <t>Type T2 nodes possess more than 1 transport, and multiple transports are
   simultaneously active at all times in a persistent manner. CoAP proxy nodes
   which allow CoAP endpoints from disparate transports to communicate with each
   other, are a good example of this.</t>

<section title="New Resource Directory Parameters">
  <t>In order to allow resource interactions between clients and servers with multiple
    locations or transports, the registration, update and lookup interfaces of
    the CoRE Resource Directory need to be extended. In this section two new RD
    parameters, "at" and "tt" are introduced. Both are optional CoAP features.
    If supported, they occur at the granularity level of an origin server, ie.
    they cannot be applied selectively on some resources only. When absent, it
    is assumed that the server does not support multiple transports or
    locations.</t>
 
 <section title="The 'at' RD parameter">
  <t>A CoAP server wishing to advertise its resources over multiple transports
  does so by using a new "at" parameter to register a list of CoAP alternative
  transport URIs during registration with a Resource Directory. Such a URI would
  contain the schemes, addresses as well as any ports or paths at which the server is available.</t>

   using a man-in-the-middle attack on TLS-based communication to a server and
   redirecting traffic to an alternate location. A malicious or compromised
   server could also be used for reflective denial-of-service attacks on
   innocent third parties. Moreover, clients may obtain web links to alternate
   URIs containing weaker security properties than the existing session.</t>

   <t>Thanks to Klaus Hartke for comments and reviewing this draft, and Teemu
   Savolainen for initial discussions about protocol negotations and lifetime
   values. Zach Shelby provided significant suggestions on how the Resource
   Directory can be employed and extended in place of link attributes and
   relation types.</t>
